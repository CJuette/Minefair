            <p>Minefair, a.k.a. Kaboom is a <b>cruel, but fair</b> Minesweeper game:</p>
            <ul style="padding-left: 20px;">
                <li>The mines are not placed at the beginning, but determined as you play. There is no hidden state.</li>
                <li>If you try to guess, the game will always choose the worst scenario.</li>
                <li>
                    Except when you are <b>forced</b> to guess (there are no safe cells anywhere). Then, guessing is completely safe.
                    <ul><li>You are still expected to select one of the <b>adjacent</b> cells.
                        Select "Allow guessing anywhere" if you want to be able to play elsewhere on the board.
                    </ul>
                </li>
